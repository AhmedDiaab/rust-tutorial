This repository is my personal space for practicing Rust coding. Here, I explore Rust concepts, experiment with different features, and build small projects to improve my skills.  

## ðŸ“Œ What I Practice  
- Rust syntax and fundamentals  
- Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes  
- Structs, enums, and pattern matching  
- Error handling and result types  
- Async programming and concurrency  
- Cargo, Crates, and Rust ecosystem tools  
- Writing tests and best practices
